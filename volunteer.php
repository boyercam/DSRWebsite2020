                    the area. This could involve, but is not limited to, writing news stories for our website, writing and 
                    recording (If you wish) stories for broadcast on the radio station & the conduction of research into 
                    community ventures and businesses to build strong links with the community.

                    <p>Gone are the days when radio stations used physical records and turntables. These days, radio stations use computer
                    systems to play music including what to play and when. Drystone Radio has lots of these systems that run alongside 
                    broadcast equipment and hardware which is responsible for getting the sound of our presenters and the music they play 
                    to your radio tuner.
